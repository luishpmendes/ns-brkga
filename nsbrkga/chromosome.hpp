/**
 * \brief Chromosone representation.
 *
 * The chromosome is represented using a vector in the unitary hypercube, i.e.,
 * \f$v \in [0,1]^n\f$ where \f$n\f$ is the size of the array (dimensions of the
 * hypercube). We use double precision because float precision maybe not be
 * enough for some applications.
 *
 * We could use `std::vector<double>` directly. However, using typedef, we can
 * add additional capabilities to the Chromosome class in the future, such as
 * parenting track. For example, we may want to do this:
 *
 * \code{.cpp}
 * class Chromosome: public std::vector<double> {
 *     public:
 *         Chromosome() :
 *             std::vector<double>(), my_personal_data(0.0)
 *             {}
 *     public:
 *         double my_personal_data;
 * };
 * \endcode
 *
 * to keep track of some data within a specifc chromosome.
 *
 * In general, most people do not recommend to inherit publicly from
 * `std::vector<>` because it has no virtual destructor. However, we may do that
 * as long as:
 *
 *   a) We remember that every operation provided by `std::vector<>` must be a
 *   semantically valid operation on an object of the derived class;
 *
 *   b) We avoid creating derived class objects with dynamic storage duration;
 *
 *   c) We **DO avoid** polymorphism:
 *      \code{.cpp}
 *      std::vector<double>* pt = new Chromosome();     // Bad idea
 *      delete pt;      // Delete does not call the Chromosome destructor
 *      \endcode
